- Check things like prefix setting
- Script to remove duplicates from user_records and user_stats, etc... and keep highest ones, as removing guild column from all user_* things to make info follow across servers
    - These will need to be run on the DB before linking it up to the new bot

- Check which commands should be able to run in DM, instead of guild, as using guild_id everywhere

For timezone stuff: pip install pytz
