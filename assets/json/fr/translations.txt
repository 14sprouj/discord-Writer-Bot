Translation from English to French (Work in progress)

Comments :
— what was deemed non translatable was left alone (several ideas/prompts, book title generators…) ;
— the bot is considered female (as assumed by its avatar)
— Generally the formal you (vous) is used (unless for some personal-sounding "reassure" commands) ;
— The goal is to be as inclusive as possible, trying not to assume the user nor the characters to be one gender or another ;
